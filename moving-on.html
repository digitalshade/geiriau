            <div class="post_words">
                <p>We are counting down the days to when our time here ends. Three years. Over a thousand days of memories shared between us. Of passion and hope. Of smiles and laughter. Of love and happiness.</p>
                <p>Emotions have spilled inside these walls. Moments of elation and grand gestures from one to the other.</p>
                <p>Offering diamond rings in the bathroom with one simple question, &#39Will you&#8230?&#39. Waiting on one knee for the answer, &#39Yes!&#39, and celebrating with smiles and tears.</p>
                <p>Our lives together have occurred only in this place, from building the first pieces of furniture to framing our moments around us. Scents of new recipes and the sounds of our friends have been absorbed into these walls where we&#39ve created our history, side by side with the place we&#39ve called our home.</p>
                <p>But now it&#39s time for us to say a fond farewell to the place where everything began. Something new and exciting is waiting for us on the other side, a place where new memories will be made and our future will be written, together.</p>
                <p>Oh, the places we&#39ll go.</p>
