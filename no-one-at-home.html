                <p>She knocked on the door and waited. Silence. She held her hand against the flaked wood, closed her eyes and breathed deeply.</p>
                <p>She turned away from the door and scanned her surroundings. This was the address she had been given but it looked as though it had been a long time since anyone else had come this way.</p>
                <p>The lawn had become overgrown and fallen leaves littered the steps to the house. Things had been neglected around here. A roughly laid rock wall trailed down the right hand side of the garden back towards the slanted gate she had entered from. Down the opposite side of the garden ran another wall, the bricks stacked neatly this time though broken in places by the recent harsh weather.</p>
                <p>Straight ahead of her stood a large horse chestnut with just a handful of golden leaves hanging onto the last throws of Autumn, the tree otherwise baring itself to the elements. A small wooden box hung from wires between the gaps, swaying softly in the breeze.</p>
                <p>She gazed towards it and focused her eyes against the winter sunlight. Another empty shell, she thought to herself, and knocked on the door one more time in hope.</p>
                <p>Silence. Nothing but silence. And no-one at home.</p>
