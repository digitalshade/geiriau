            <h3 class="post_title">The Door</h3>
            <div class="post_words">
                <p>She pressed the button for number seven and waited. A stifled buzz rang out from the intercom and drifted away to meet the sounds of the street. As she leant against the thick set wooden door, shifting her gaze towards the passing traffic, the already worn paint cracked under the touch of her shoulder and crumbled down to the pavement.</p>
                <p>To the pedestrians and motorists passing by, the door was nothing to look at. In fact, they&#39d be forgiven for assuming it was out of use. Nobody knew how long it had been there exactly. All they knew was that despite the building around it changing frequently over the decades, the door had always remained standing.</p>
                <p>It was hard to tell if nature had been kind to it over the years, though it seemed to have survived remarkably well given it&#39s estimated age. It was not without it&#39s problems, the thick mahogany frame was more than a bit rough around the edges with crops of splinters splitting out all along it. The large iron plate which held the keyhole had rusted heavily on the surface but somehow still remained incredibly solid.</p>
                <p>The door itself held the scars of nature, accumulated over what must have been at least half a century of sun and snow and ice and wind and rain, leaving it with the look of a weathered old man after years wandering through the elements unprotected. In it&#39s seasoned face were stories of love and passion, of grief and loss, of ignorance and violence.</p>
                <p>Words and initials had been carved and drawn on the surface, overwritten or worn off and then replaced by a new artistï¿½s name or message. They all had a meaning to someone, probably not to the girl who stood there now, exhaling delicate puffs of smoke from her lips as she waited patiently for an invitation through the door, but to someone.</p>
                <p>And somewhere, in those seconds, they would remember what they had shared with that door in the years gone before and as the buzzer whirred and released the lock, as the girl tossed her cigarette stub to the floor and pushed open the door to enter, that someone, somewhere, would smile.</p>
